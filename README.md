# BrowserStack


Hey BrowserStack team! We're a community of security researchers that often needs to test the differences between the JavaScript engines in Safari, Firefox, and Chrome. Is this something you'd consider giving us access for? We aren't using GitHub a ton, but we do have an active discord at `ctbb.show/discord`.
